## 2024-06-16 - Form Feedback UX
**Learning:** Users often feel uncertain when a form submission has no visible state change. Providing an immediate "submitting" state and an accessible success message significantly improves perceived reliability.
**Action:** Always implement a submission status state for forms, including a disabled state for the submit button and a ARIA-live region for status updates.

## 2025-05-14 - Keyboard Navigation Visibility
**Learning:** Global focus states were inconsistent or missing, hindering keyboard navigation. Using :focus-visible with a high-contrast outline and subtle box-shadow ensures accessibility without affecting mouse users' experience.
**Action:** Apply a consistent :focus-visible style in App.css using AICADO's primary blue (#2a77de) and ensure a 'Skip to Content' link is present in the root Layout.

## 2024-05-20 - Visual Feedback for Form Submission
**Learning:** Adding a spinner and "Sending..." text to buttons during async operations provides immediate confirmation that the user's action was registered, reducing multiple click attempts and frustration.
**Action:** Use a consistent CSS spinner and button state change for all primary form submissions.
